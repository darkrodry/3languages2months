# 3 languages in 2 months challange

This repo contains the code for the "3 languages in 2 months challange" proposed by Antonio Leiva in [http://devexperto.com/lenguajes-reto/](http://devexperto.com/lenguajes-reto/). I choose to learn Go, Ruby and Clojure, and code a koan and the bowling kata for every languaje.

## Go

I have chosen to learn Go using the [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org) online exercises.

## Ruby

I have chosen to use [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) and take a look at [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide](https://www.amazon.es/Programming-Ruby-1-9-2-0-Programmers/dp/1937785491/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) to learn Ruby.

## Clojure

I have chosen to learn Clojure using the [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com/) with the help of [Clojure Docs](https://clojuredocs.org/).
